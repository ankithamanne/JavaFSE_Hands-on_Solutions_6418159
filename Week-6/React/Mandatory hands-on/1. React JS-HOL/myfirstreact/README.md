### 1. REACT JS-HOL

#### OBJECTIVES:

## 1. What is a SPA and what are its benefits?

A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the whole page. It relies heavily on JavaScript and client-side routing.

**Benefits of SPA:**
- Fast and responsive user experience
- Reduces full page reloads
- Smooth navigation
- Better performance after initial load

## 2. Define React and identify its working?

**React** is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It works using a **component-based architecture** and a **virtual DOM** to efficiently update and render UI components.

React updates only the parts of the DOM that change, improving performance through a process called **reconciliation**.

## 3. Identify the differences between SPA and MPA?

| Feature               | SPA (Single Page App)              | MPA (Multi Page App)               |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Structure             | Single HTML page                   | Multiple HTML pages                |
| Speed                 | Faster after initial load          | Slower due to full page reloads    |
| Navigation            | Handled via JavaScript (no reload) | Each page reloads on navigation    |
| Development complexity| Less                                | More                               |
| SEO                   | More challenging                   | Easier for crawlers                |

## 4. Explain Pros & Cons of a Single-Page Application?

**Pros:**
- Fast and smooth user experience
- Reduces server requests
- Easy to build with modern frameworks

**Cons:**
- Poor SEO if not handled properly
- Initial load can be heavy
- Requires JavaScript to function properly

## 5. Explain about React.

**React** is a UI library that allows developers to build reusable components that manage their own state and combine to create complex user interfaces. Itâ€™s declarative, meaning developers describe what they want the UI to look like, and React handles the rendering.

---

## 6. Define Virtual DOM?

The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. React uses it to compare changes before applying them to the real DOM using a technique called **diffing**. This improves performance by minimizing DOM manipulation.

---

## 7. Explain features of React?

- **Component-based**: Reusable, self-contained pieces of UI
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering mechanism
- **Declarative UI**: Easy to understand and maintain
- **JSX Syntax**: Write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript
- **Unidirectional data flow**: Predictable state management
- **Strong ecosystem**: Integration with tools like Redux, React Router, etc.
