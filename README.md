# Digital Nurture 4.0 – Java Full Stack Engineer (Java FSE)

This repository contains my hands-on solutions for the **Digital Nurture 4.0 Java Full Stack Engineer (Java FSE)** program offered by **Cognizant**.

The Java FSE program is designed to train associates on end-to-end full stack development using modern backend, frontend, and DevOps technologies. The curriculum includes hands-on modules in Java, PL/SQL, Spring Boot, REST APIs, Microservices, React/Angular, CI/CD, and Cloud basics.

Each hands-on problem focuses on practical scenarios involving:
- Core Java concepts and design patterns  
- Database programming with SQL and PL/SQL  
- Test-Driven Development using JUnit and Mockito  
- Backend services using Spring Boot and Microservices architecture  
- Frontend development using React or Angular  
- DevOps tools like Git, Maven, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines

All exercises are completed as per Cognizant's official handbook, and terminal output screenshots are included as proof of successful execution.

> This repository is intended for submission and review by Cognizant mentors and SMEs.
