# 11. React JS-HOL

## Objectives:

## 1. Explain React Events
React events are JavaScript events wrapped in a cross-browser wrapper called **SyntheticEvent**. They behave similarly to native events but work identically across all browsers. React handles events like `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`, etc., using camelCase syntax and passes functions as event handlers.


## 2. Explain About Event Handlers
Event handlers are functions that are triggered when specific actions occur, such as a user clicking a button or typing into an input field. In React, event handlers are defined as functions and passed to components as props. 
For example:
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>


## 3. Define Synthetic Event

A Synthetic Event is a React wrapper around the browserâ€™s native event system. It provides consistent behavior and interface for handling events across different browsers. It pools events for performance reasons and mimics the native event APIs.


## 4. Identify React Event Naming Convention

React uses camelCase for event names instead of lowercase like HTML. For example:

HTML: <button onclick="doSomething()">Click</button>
React: <button onClick={doSomething}>Click</button>
